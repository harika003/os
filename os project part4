2. Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more than 10 time units. CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. CPU is idle for 3 time units and does not entertain any process prior this time. Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of all the processes. Compute average waiting and turnaround time.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
  int count,j,n;
  int time,remaining;
  int flag=0,time_quantum=10; 
  int waiting_time=0,turn_around_time=0,arrival_time[10],burst_time[10],rt[10]; 
  printf("\n\nEnter the Total number of Process:\t "); 
  scanf("%d",&n); 
  remaining=n; 
  for(count=0;count<n;count++) 
  { 
    printf("Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process Process Number %d :",count+1); 
    scanf("%d",&arrival_time[count]); 
    scanf("%d",&burst_time[count]); 
    rt[count]=burst_time[count]; 
  }
